This project contains both the main file for the server and client.

To run the server, first run the PingServer.java file

To run the client, run the PingClient.java

The corresponding jar files are also located in the 'out' folder. You can run the server jar if needed and then run the client from the IDE. IntelliJ allows you to switch between main files so that is what I did.
